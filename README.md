LBP
===

C++ implementation of the Local Binary Pattern texture descriptors. This class integrates with OpenCV and FFTW3 to bring a complete and fast implementation of the popular descriptors: LBP u2, ri, riu2 &amp; hf. The routines for calculating these descriptors are inspired by the Matlab code of the original authors.
